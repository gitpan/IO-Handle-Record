	* Torsten Foertsch <torsten.foertsch@gmx.net>
	- changed "package IO::Handle" to "package IO::Handle::Record"
	  to get the module indexed by the CPAN indexer.
	- pushed 'IO::Handle::Record' to @IO::Handle::ISA to make IO::Handle
	  inherit from IO::Handle::Record
	- this seems to be functionally equivalent to the previous version
